* Linux "cooked" capture encapsulation
   the link-layer header contains, in order:
 
     a 2-byte "packet type", in network byte order, which is one of:
       0    packet was sent to us by somebody else
       1    packet was broadcast by somebody else
       2    packet was multicast, but not broadcast, by somebody else
       3    packet was sent by somebody else to somebody else
       4    packet was sent by us

   a 2-byte field, in network byte order, containing a Linux ARPHRD_
   value for the link-layer device type;

   a 2-byte field, in network byte order, containing the length of the
   link-layer address of the sender of the packet (which could be 0);

   an 8-byte field containing that number of bytes of the link-layer
   address of the sender (if there are more than 8 bytes, only the
   first 8 are present,  and if there are fewer than 8 bytes, there
   are padding bytes after the address to pad the field to 8 bytes);

   a  2-byte  field  containing an Ethernet protocol type, in network
   byte order, or containing 1 for Novell 802.3 frames without an
   802.2 LLC header or 4 for frames beginning with an 802.2 LLC header.

* OpenBSD loopback encapsulation protocol
   the link-layer header is a 4-byte field, in network byte order,
   containing a PF_ value from OpenBSD's socket.h for the
   network-layer protocol of the packet.
